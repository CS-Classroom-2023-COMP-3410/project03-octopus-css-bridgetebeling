When working on this project, I noticed that one of the biggest challenges was communicating small details effectively. I often found that I had to re-explain parts of my ideas because the initial changes didn’t fully capture what I was looking for. For example, when I wanted certain text aligned a specific way or specific colors applied, the updates would sometimes only partially meet what I was asking. This made the process feel a bit repetitive at times, and it required patience to keep repeating until everything was correct.

Another challenge was dealing with changes that undid previous ones. I’d finally get one aspect of the page to look right, only to realize that a later adjustment overwrote it. This was especially frustrating because I had to keep revisiting and rechecking work I thought was already finished. To work around this, I had to get even more intentional about explaining exactly what needed to stay the same and what needed to change with each new update.

Despite these challenges, I learned a lot about the importance of breaking down tasks into clear, manageable pieces. I also realized how critical it is to keep track of progress so earlier decisions aren’t accidentally reversed. This helped me develop a better approach giving chat detailed prompts, and it reinforced the importance of clear communication and persistence when trying to bring a web design to life with the help of chat.
